	This reproducibility report shows the following: 
	\begin{itemize}
        \item The new dataset contradicts the conclusion in the original paper that the Content-Length in HAR files is the most reliable data source for object sizes but does confirm the large inconsistencies in object size between data sources.
        \item The other examined conclusions regarding redirects and object count / byte index were confirmed by the new dataset.
        \item The data in both papers underlines the importance of improving the documentation of studies of web performance as well as choosing performance metrics carefully and deliberately. 
   	 \end{itemize}
